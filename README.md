# The Four Pillars of Object Oriented Programming
This program was refactored to reflect the four pillars of object oriented programming. I used ChatGPT to help make part of the program, but most of the work involving the four pillars of OOP were implemented by me.

## Introduction
This program is a text/console based point-of-sale
software with the ability to process and store to-go
and dine-in orders. It also has the ability to display
receipts, reset orders, and store order information such
as name, phone number, table number, and amount of people.

### Java Programming Concepts Utilized
Data types, variables, control structures such as loops and conditional statements, data structures such as arrays, the use of the Scanner class for user input, defining and calling methods, and formatting output using printf.
+ Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, Encapsulation
