Java POS Program
> a console-based POS program in Java



## Introduction
This program is a text/console based point-of-sale
software with the ability to process and store to-go
and dine-in orders. It also has the ability to display
receipts, reset orders, and store order information such
as name, phone number, table number, and amount of people.

This program was refactored to reflect the four pillars of object oriented programming using minimal assistance from ChatGPT.
